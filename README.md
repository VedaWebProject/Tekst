> [!IMPORTANT]
> Tekst is still in development. We're currently testing Tekst internally and implementing the last missing bits. As soon as we're ready for it, the new [VedaWeb platform](https://vedaweb.uni-koeln.de) will become the first public instance of Tekst. Until then, you are welcome to follow the development in this very repository.

Tekst is developed within the scope of the [VedaWeb 2.0](https://vedaweb.uni-koeln.de/) research project on Old Indic texts, where it constitutes the technical basis of the research platform "VedaWeb", which will be launched in its new form as part of the project's efforts.

## Publications

We presented our vision for a collaborative text research platform at the **DH2023** conference (Digital Humanities 2023. Collaboration as Opportunity, Graz, Austria, 10-14 July 2023). You can find the abstract of our presentation [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8107794)!
