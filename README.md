# TextRig <!-- omit in toc -->

TextRig is a collaborative, web-based research platform for displaying, linking, exploring, and enriching natural language texts. It is developed within the scope of the [VedaWeb 2.0](https://vedaweb.uni-koeln.de/) research project on Old Indic texts, where it constitutes the technical basis of the research platforms spawned as part of the project's efforts.

This is the "main" TextRig repository. While certain parts of the apllication code have their own repositories (namely the client and server projects), this repository is meant as the go-to place for general information, documentation and the resources needed to deploy an instance of the TextRig platform. For an overview of the repositories, see [TextRig Repositories](#textrig-repositories).

## State of development

Development on this software is in an early conceptual phase. At this point, there is no usable release or public instance. 


## TextRig Repositories

The code and resources of the TextRig platform application are organized in the following repositories:

| üè∑Ô∏è Name | üîó Link | üìÉ Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TextRig | [VedaWebProject/TextRig](https://github.com/VedaWebProject/TextRig) | This very repository. A place for general information, documentation and the resources needed to deploy an instance of the TextRig platform. |
| TextRig-client | [VedaWebProject/TextRig-client](https://github.com/VedaWebProject/TextRig-client) | The code base of the TextRig **client** application and the resources needed to deploy it. |
