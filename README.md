# Tekst <!-- omit in toc -->

Tekst is a collaborative, web-based research platform for displaying, linking, exploring, and enriching natural language texts. It is developed within the scope of the [VedaWeb 2.0](https://vedaweb.uni-koeln.de/) research project on Old Indic texts, where it constitutes the technical basis of the research platforms spawned as part of the project's efforts.

This is the "main" Tekst repository. While certain parts of the apllication code have their own repositories (namely the client and server projects), this repository is meant as the go-to place for general information, documentation and the resources needed to deploy an instance of the Tekst platform. For an overview of the repositories, see [Tekst Repositories](#tekst-repositories).

## State of development

Development on this software is in an early conceptual phase. At this point, there is no usable release or public instance.


## Tekst Repositories

The code and resources of the Tekst platform application are organized in the following repositories:

| Repository | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Tekst](https://github.com/VedaWebProject/tekst) | This very repository. A place for general information, documentation and the resources needed to deploy an instance of the Tekst platform. |
| [tekst-client](https://github.com/VedaWebProject/tekst-client) | The code base of the Tekst **client** application and the resources needed to deploy it. |
| [tekst-server](https://github.com/VedaWebProject/tekst-server) | The code base of the Tekst **server** application and the resources needed to deploy it. |
