*...as in* **T**ext **E**xploration *and* **K**nowledge **S**tructuring **T**ool

> âš  Tekst is still somewhere between a conceptual phase and its early stages of development. As of now there's no stable (let alone production-ready) version available.
> As soon as we're ready for it, the VedaWeb platform will become the first public instance of Tekst. Until then, you are welcome to follow the development of Tekst here and in the code repositories mentioned below.

Tekst is a collaborative, web-based research platform for displaying, linking, exploring, and enriching resources on natural language texts. It is developed within the scope of the [VedaWeb 2.0](https://vedaweb.uni-koeln.de/) research project on Old Indic texts, where it constitutes the technical basis of the research platform "VedaWeb", which will be launched in its new form as part of the project's efforts.

This is the "main" Tekst repository. While the actual application code has its own repositories (namely the server and client application projects), this very repository is meant to be the go-to place for general information, documentation and the resources needed to deploy an instance of the Tekst platform for yourself or your research project.

If, however, you want to visit or even contribute to the Tekst code repositories, here's where to look first:

- [**Tekst-API**](https://github.com/VedaWebProject/Tekst-API) - Codebase of the **Tekst** *server* application.
- [**Tekst-Web**](https://github.com/VedaWebProject/Tekst-Web) - Codebase of the **Tekst** *client* application.

## What is Tekst, really?

ðŸš§ **TODO:** Answer the question.


## Deployment

### Docker (recommended)
To deploy Tekst with Docker, follow these steps (example commands assume using some kind of loosely POSIX compliant shell):

1. Requirements:
   - [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
   - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install) and Docker Compose. If you're on Linux, the [docker-compose-plugin](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/) for Docker is recommended. Otherwise there's [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/other/) standalone, for which the commands below have to be run as `docker-compose ...` instead of `docker compose ...`

2. Clone this repository and change into the resulting directory:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/VedaWebProject/tekst.git
    cd tekst
    ```

3. Copy the `.env.docker` file and name the copy `.env`:

    ```sh
    cp .env.docker .env
    ```

4. Configure the values in `.env` to match your deployment environment and needed features. Use the comments in those files for guidance. If you leave everything unchanged, Tekst will run with sensible defaults for a full-featured, Docker-based production environment served at `/` (root path). By default, the application will later be available via the local port `8087` at `127.0.0.1`.

5. Build the docker images for the **tekst-api** (server) and **tekst-web** (client) applications. **Important:** Whenever you decide to change one of `TEKST_WEB_PATH`, `TEKST_SERVER_URL` or `TEKST_API_PATH` in your `.env` file, you'll have to build the image for **tekst-web** (client) again, as these values are statically replaced in the code during the build process!

    ```sh
    docker compose build tekst-api tekst-web
    ```

    ... now grab a (small) coffee â˜•

6. Run the complete application stack with:

    ```sh
    docker compose up
    ```

    Add the `-d` flag to run it in detached mode (in the background).

7. Read [this](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/compose/) to learn how to stop, start, reset (...) the application stack using Docker Compose.
