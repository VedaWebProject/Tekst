> 🏗 Tekst is still in a pre-alpha stage. As of now there's no complete (let alone production-ready) version available.
> As soon as we're ready for it, the new [VedaWeb platform](https://vedaweb.uni-koeln.de/rigveda) will become the first public instance of Tekst. Until then, you are welcome to follow the development of Tekst in this very repository.

Tekst is a collaborative, web-based research platform for aligning, displaying, linking, exploring, and enriching resources on natural language texts (and more). It is developed within the scope of the [VedaWeb 2.0](https://vedaweb.uni-koeln.de/) research project on Old Indic texts, where it constitutes the technical basis of the research platform "VedaWeb", which will be launched in its new form as part of the project's efforts.

## Publications

We presented our vision for a collaborative research platform at the **DH2023** conference (Digital Humanities 2023. Collaboration as Opportunity, Graz, Austria, 10-14 July 2023). You can find our conference paper [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8107794)!


## Development

This is a monorepo containing the codebases of the Tekst server project ([Tekst-API](Tekst-API)), the Tekst client project ([Tekst-Web](Tekst-Web)) and the [documentation](https://vedawebproject.github.io/Tekst), as well as the resources needed for deployment. The different project directories contain their own respective `README.md` files covering the development tooling and overall project setup.
