  schiller: |
    Angel-fair, Walhalla's charms displaying,
    Fairer than all mortal youths was he;
    Mild his look, as May-day sunbeams straying
    Gently o'er the blue and glassy sea.

    And his kisses! what ecstatic feeling!
    Like two flames that lovingly entwine,
    Like the harp's soft tones together stealing
    Into one sweet harmony divine,

    Soul and soul embraced, commingled, blended,
    Lips and cheeks with trembling passion burned,
    Heaven and earth, in pristine chaos ended,
    Round the blissful lovers madly turn'd.

    He is gone and, ah! with bitter anguish
    Vainly now I breathe my mournful sighs;
    He is gone in hopeless grief I languish
    Earthly joys I ne'er again can prize!
