We'll try to keep it up-to-date and complete it as soon as possible, but please bear with us if you encounter any incomplete or outdated information.</p> <p>Tekst is a collaborative, web-based research platform for aligning, displaying, linking, exploring, and enriching resources on natural language texts (and more). It is developed within the scope of the VedaWeb 2.0 research project, where it constitutes the technical basis of the VedaWeb research platform.</p>"},{"location":"#use-cases","title":"Use cases","text":"<p>Tekst is primarily meant as a platform software for philological research projects. The original intent for the development of Tekst was to create the technical basis for the online research platform VedaWeb, where numerous resources on multiple Old Indic Sanskrit texts can be browsed, compared and searched. These include text versions, translations, annotations, audio recordings of recitations and references to external sources, which are all aligned to the structure of their respective reference texts.</p> <p>Therefore, the main use cases for Tekst are comparable research projects that either want to publish and showcase their research data, simply curate a set of established resources on certain reference texts, or even encourage the research community to participate and contribute to a central platform dedicated to provide relevant resources.</p> <p>In the end, giving it a try on your local machine is relatively easy.</p>"},{"location":"#features","title":"Features","text":"<p>This list is far from exhaustive, but includes some features that might be decisive in certain scenarios:</p> <ul> <li>Manage multiple independent, potentially differently structured texts and arbitrary related resources in a single platform instance</li> <li>One common user base for the whole platform</li> <li>Built-in i18n with an extensible set of languages (contributions welcome!)</li> <li>Integrated user management with authentication and a combination of role-based and ownership-based authorization</li> <li>Optional Closed Mode to disable public registrations (or applications) for an internally curated platform without user contributions</li> <li>Customization of<ul> <li>Content fonts</li> <li>On-screen keyboard character sets</li> <li>UI Colors</li> <li>...</li> </ul> </li> <li>Extensively typed and documented server API (via OpenAPI specification) and built-in interactive API documentation (via Swagger UI and/or ReDoc), all thanks to FastAPI</li> <li>...</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#conceptual-caveats","title":"Conceptual Caveats","text":"<p>Depending on your requirements, you might want to consider the following list of potential shortcomings:</p> <ul> <li>SEO: The web client is a SPA that is rendered in the browser (no SSR).

Switching to a different reference text changes the working context of Tekst, including available resources, settings, etc.</p> <p>Each text's structure has to be modeled in advance to lay the foundation for Tekst to work with it. The structure model of a text has to follow a clear hierarchical scheme of nested structure levels (e.g. \"Series\" contains \"Book\" contains \"Chapter\" contains \"Paragraph\" contains \"Sentence\").</p> <p>Each structure level must be subordinate to one parent structure level and can have at most one direct child level. It is not possible to have two structure levels modeled as siblings under the same parent level.</p> <p>Example</p> <p>A book's chapters may contain footnotes you'd want to model separately from the paragraphs contained in the chapters. This is not possible via the structure model. But you may very well just use a structure of \"Chapter\" containing \"Paragraph\" and associate resources containing resources on the footnotes to each location on the \"Paragraph\" level.</p> <p>The reason for this limitation is the concept of exploratory browsing implemented by Tekst. For being able to skip through the locations on a certain structure level like you turn the pages of a book, there has to be both a clear hierarchy of structure levels as well as a sequencial order of the locations on each level.</p> <p> Data model: Example of a simple song structure modeled for use as a reference work (or \"text\") in Tekst, with a selection of (partly imaginary) resources associated with each structure level. A resource may provide zero to one contents per location on its respective structure level.</p>"},{"location":"concepts/#resources","title":"Resources","text":"<p>Info</p> <p>The following selection of resource types is just a part of what is currently planned.
