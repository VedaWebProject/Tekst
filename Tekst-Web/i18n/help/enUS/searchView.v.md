# Search

The search feature allows you to specifically search within the data of selected resources. Since multiple search queries can be combined and configured very precisely, highly efficient and, if necessary, very complex search queries can be realized.

## Search Queries

A search consists of 1 to n search queries. Each search query targets a specific resource, which is selected using the first selection field of the respective query. It can also be specified whether the query should be required, optional, or excluded. The search is conducted for locations that meet all defined search queries.

**Caution:** There can also be combinations of search queries that _cannot_ yield any results — such as two "required" queries for content from resources that pertain to different texts.

Each resource type offers a different search form adapted to the structure of its data. Therefore, the search form of a search query changes depending on the selected target resource.

## Settings

### Respect Diacritics

If this feature is activated, entered or missing (!) diacritics are taken into account during the search, and only content with the same use of diacritics will be found.

### Location Range

If all selected resources are associated with the same structural level of the same text, the range of locations to be searched can be restricted here.
