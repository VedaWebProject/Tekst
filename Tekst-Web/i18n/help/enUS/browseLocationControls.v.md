# Selection of Structure Level and Location

Here you can specifically select a location for which you want to display content. Locations can be part of different structural levels of a text; for example, a location can be a chapter, a paragraph, or a sentence.

Different resources can be associated with different structural levels of a text. Generally, content from higher-level locations — meaning from hierarchically higher structural levels — will also be displayed. Therefore, in most cases, it's desirable to display content at the lowest structural level. However, if you want to see combined content from a higher level (for instance, "all sentences from Chapter 1"), you can select the appropriate level here.

Of course, the level names mentioned above are just examples and can be entirely different depending on the text. You can check the available levels in the selection list.
