# Reading View

This is the main view of the platform. Here, the contents of any combination of resources can be displayed, browsed, and compared — aligned with the structure of the selected working text. Additionally, the reading view offers numerous quick access options to various functions associated with the respective contents.

**In a nutshell:** Navigate the locations using the arrow buttons in the toolbar (or the arrow keys on your keyboard) and select the desired resources for display using the resource selector button on the far right!

## Location Label

The heading of this view always displays the full designation of the current location path. It is composed of the combined labels of the individual locations, from the highest level to the lowest, namely the currently displayed location.

## Location Aliases

If available, location aliases will be displayed below the heading. You can copy a URL to the current location including a certain alias by clicking on it. Moreover, location aliases can be entered in the quick search (top right in the header of the page) to jump directly to the corresponding location.

## The Toolbar

The prominent toolbar provides the essential functions for using the reading view. It is always visible and remains anchored at the top of the screen when scrolling. Below are brief explanations of its functions.

### Navigation

The navigation tools are located on the left side of the toolbar.

#### Simple Paging

With the arrow buttons in the toolbar, you can easily jump to the previous or next location in the text structure. Alternatively, you can also use the arrow keys on your keyboard.

#### Targeted Selection of Level and Location

The button with the book icon opens the selection tool for jumping to a specific location. You can also switch the structural level you want to browse. The selection tool has its own help text that explains the concept of structural levels in more detail.

#### Personal Bookmarks

This function is only available for logged-in users. With the bookmark tool, you can save your preferred locations with a comment and access them later.

### Focus View

To better compare content or read with fewer distractions, the focus view can be activated. The button for this is located on the right side of the toolbar. In the focus view, the quick functions of the content are more hidden, the headers of the resource categories are concealed, and the content is presented more compactly.

### Resource Selection

On the far right of the toolbar is the button that displays the selection of all resources available for the current working text. Here, resources or entire categories can be quickly shown or hidden in a clear manner.

## Content

In the main area of the reading view, the contents of the selected resources for the current working text are displayed. They may be divided into categories. If resources of a specific category are hidden, all contents can be shown again via a small "show all" button next to the category header.

The contents themselves are labeled with the title of their respective resource and also provide quick access to various functions. The most basic ones include the buttons to hide the contents of the respective resource and the info button, which displays additional information about the resource. Additionally, the export tool can be opened here, allowing the contents of the corresponding resource to be downloaded in various file formats.

Other functions differ based on resource type (and user role). Hover over the icons in the header of each content item to see a brief description of the available functions.
