## Proposal for publication

By proposing a resource you created for publication, you make it available to all registered users of the platform for them to review your work, comment on it and propose changes or additions. The platform administrators will be informed about your proposal and may publish your resource on the platform to also make it accessible to non-registered users.

Resources that are proposed for publication cannot be edited. Also, all shared access permissions for the resource are reset.

If a resource is published, the platform administrators gain exclusive control over this resource to prevent any unwanted changes. You can still propose changes to the data of the resource later, but those will have to be approved separately.

A publication proposal can be withdrawn as long as the resource has not been published.
