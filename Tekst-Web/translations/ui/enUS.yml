        Deleting this text ("{title}") will delete all data associated with it,
        including its configured structure and all data layers, regardless of the
        user who created it. Are you sure?

      warnInsertLevel: |
        Retroactively inserting a text level is an operation with serious
        impact on the text's data model. The application will try its best to embed the
        new level into the existing data structure, but you will have to adjust the
        result to your needs using the text's structure nodes settings afterwards.
        Also, it is recommended to make a backup of the current state of your database
        before performing this operation.
      warnDeleteLevel: |
        Deleting a text level has far-reaching consequences: All data associated
        with this text level will be deleted with it. This includes all (!) data layers
        on this level, regardless of the user who created it!
        The application will try its best to re-connect adjacent levels,
        but you will have to adjust the result to your needs using the text's
        structure nodes settings afterwards.
        Please make sure you know what you are doing and make a backup
        of your database before doing this! Are you sure you want to delete the text
        level "{levelLabel}"?

      warnGeneral: |
        Rearranging or deleting text nodes has serious impact on the text's data model.
        It is recommended to make a backup of the current state of your
        database before making any changes, here.
      warnDeleteNode: |
        If you delete this node, all data associated with it or its child nodes will
        be deleted with it. This can potentially affect all data layers,
        even ones created by other users. If what you want to do can be achieved by
        merely moving the node within the structure level it is on, you should do
        so instead, as moving nodes works without deleting any data.
        Now, are you really sure you want to delete the selected structure node?
