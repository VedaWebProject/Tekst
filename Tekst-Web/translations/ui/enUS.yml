        Deleting this text ("{title}") will delete all data associated with it,
        including its configured structure and all resources, regardless of the
        user who created it. This cannot be undone. Are you sure?

      warnInsertLevel: |
        Retroactively inserting a text level is an operation with serious
        impact on the text's data model. The application will try its best to embed the
        new level into the existing data structure, but you will have to adjust the
        result to your needs using the text's locations settings afterwards.
        Also, it is recommended to make a backup of the current state of your database
        before performing this operation.
      warnDeleteLevel: |
        Deleting a text level has far-reaching consequences: All data associated
        with this text level will be deleted with it. This includes all (!) resources
        on this level, regardless of the user who created it!
        The application will try its best to re-connect adjacent levels,
        but you will have to adjust the result to your needs using the text's
        locations settings afterwards. This cannot be undone.
        Please make sure you know what you are doing and make a backup
        of your database before doing this! Are you sure you want to delete the text
        level "{levelLabel}"?

      warnGeneral: |
        Rearranging or deleting text locations has serious impact on the text's data model.
        It is recommended to make a backup of the current state of your
        database before making any changes, here.
      warnDeleteLocation: |
        If you delete this location, all data associated with it or its child locations will
        be deleted with it. This can potentially affect all resources,
        even ones created by other users. If what you want to do can be achieved by
        merely moving the location within the structure level it is on, you should do
        so instead, as moving locations works without deleting any data.
        This cannot be undone.
        Now, are you really sure you want to delete the selected location?
