        Retroactively inserting a text level is an operation with serious

        Also, it is recommended to make a backup of the current state of your database

        Deleting a text level has far-reaching consequences: All data associated
        with this text level will be deleted with it. This includes all (!) resources
        on this level, regardless of the user who created it!
        The application will try its best to re-connect adjacent levels,
        but you will have to adjust the result to your needs using the text's
        locations settings afterwards. This cannot be undone.
