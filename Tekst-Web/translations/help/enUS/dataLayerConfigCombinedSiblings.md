# Display combined content on the next higher level

If this function is activated for a data layer, its contents are also visible on the next higher structure level. A button is then added to the display of the data layer that enables the combined display of all content that is assigned to the same higher-level structure node. In addition, the data layer is then also displayed at the higher level so that this function is also directly accessible there.

Example: With a data layer at the "Sentence" level, all content for the higher-level node at the "Paragraph" level would be displayed together.

**ATTENTION: This function should only be activated for data layers that only contain very little or short content for individual locations, e.g. at the "Verse" level for a poem.**
