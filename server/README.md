# TextRig

TextRig is a collaborative, web-based research platform for displaying, linking, exploring, and enriching natural language texts. It is developed within the scope of the [VedaWeb 2.0](https://vedaweb.uni-koeln.de/) research project on Old Indic texts, where it constitutes the technical basis of the research platforms spawned as part of the project's efforts.


## State of development

Development on this software is in an early conceptual phase. At this point, there is no usable release or public instance.
