# Contributing

Tekst is explicitly meant as an Open Source project. As such, you are welcome to open Pull Requests with bug fixes or feature implementations.
That being said, to keep you from doing superfluous work, please [open an issue](https://github.com/VedaWebProject/Tekst/issues) describing a bug or feature idea before
you start working on things and discuss the matter with a project maintainer â™¥
