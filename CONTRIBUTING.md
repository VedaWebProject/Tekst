# Contributing

Tekst is explicitly meant as an Open Source project that is open for community contributions. You are welcome to open Pull Requests with bug fixes or feature implementations.

That being said, to keep you from doing superfluous work, please [open an issue](https://github.com/VedaWebProject/Tekst/issues) describing a bug or feature idea and discuss the matter with a project maintainer before you start working on things â™¥
