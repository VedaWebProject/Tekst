# Tekst

At some point in the future, this place will provide thorough documentation of the Tekst platform.

Tekst is a collaborative, web-based research platform for displaying, linking, exploring, and enriching resources on natural language texts. It is developed within the scope of the [VedaWeb 2.0](https://vedaweb.uni-koeln.de/) research project on Old Indic texts, where it constitutes the technical basis of the research platform "VedaWeb", which will be launched in its new form as part of the project's efforts.
