# Data Layers

## Publication Proposals

By proposing a data layer you created for publication, you make it available to all registered users of the platform for them to review your work, comment on it and propose changes or additions. The platform administrators will be informed about your proposal and may publish your data layer on the platform to also make it accessible to non-registered users.

If this happens, the platform administrators gain exclusive control over this data layer to prevent any unwanted changes. You can still propose changes to your data later, but those will have to be approved separately.

A publication proposal can be withdrawn as long as the data layer has not been published.
