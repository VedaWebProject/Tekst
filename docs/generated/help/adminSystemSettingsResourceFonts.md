## Custom Resource Fonts

You can provide yourself and other users with the option to use alternative fonts for specific resources. This can be useful when the content of a resource uses a specific character set or diacritics that cannot be displayed by the default font for content.

Please refer to the "Setup / Customization" guide in the main documentation to learn how to do this.
